## Details
* "Import_xml_button" --> This automatically adds a button on retrived update sets. When developing I find this quicker to upload update sets. 
* "Slack_Incident_Notifications_Integration" --> This custom integration sets your instance up to have notifications sent out to your slack team when Incidents are created or updated. All setup after downloading the update set is done in the menu "Slack".
